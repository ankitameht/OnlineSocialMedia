# OnlineSocialMedia
Social Networking is the way people are connected in 21st century. You have to build a mini version of a fully functional Social Networking Site. Let us call this application ConnectBook (or any cool name that you can come up with :­) ). ConnectBook is a place where people can sign up for an account and meet their friends, family, and acquaintances online. Each account has a ‘Wall’ where people can post their status messages (text messages). A person ‘A’ can see another person ‘B’s’ status messages only if ‘B’ is in ‘A’s’ friend list. To befriend someone, one has to send the intended person a friend request. Once this request gets accepted, they both become each other's friend and their names appear in each other's friend list. After two people become friends, their Walls show the status updates from each other.
A person can have several friends on ConnectBook. Further, whenever a person updates her status, all her friends are notified of this change and every friend’s wall shows the status update (please note that Wall in this project is different from the Wall of the Facebook). One can see her Wall by logging into her account. Once she logs out, the general screen of the ConnectBook is displayed which has two options: Sign up and Log in.
